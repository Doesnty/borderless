## About the game

This game uses a type chart unique to it. It is not the 1.8 type chart, though it is rather close to it.

Puppets have multiple styles they can evolve into, similar to 1.8. However, shards are no longer evolutionary stones. Instead, the Puppet must hold the shard when it reaches its usual evolution level. Only chibi puppets can evolve; once a Puppet evolves once, it's done.

Useful information can be found in the notes directory.


## FAQ

Q: Why is my Puppet picking up items?

A: Every Puppet has intrinsic Pickup in this game. Puppets that are higher-level and better trained tend to pick up better things, but usually just berries.

Certain species can also find different items. The Pickup ability gives the Puppet a chance to find man-made items in addition to regular ones.


Q: Can I change EVs/IVs/Nature/Ability?

A: Yes, but not from the start of the game.


Q: I found a reference to Pokemon in the game.

A: Yes, that's intentional. The setting is still Kanto Pokemon, there are Pokemon running around; it's too much of a hassle and often kind of weird/creepy to convert every Pokemon reference to Puppets.

If you're wondering why they aren't in gameplay, just think of it as the player character not being interested in that side of Kanto. You don't see Pokemon Gyms in-game for the same reason you don't see bedrooms or toilets in houses, they aren't important. Red is off doing his own thing somewhere in the Pokemon League, but it's not of interest. Puppets and Pokemon get along in the wild, and trainers don't make them fight against each other since that would be barbaric. Wild Pokemon don't bother you because Pokemon-brand Repel is cheap enough to have on at all times, without player input.
